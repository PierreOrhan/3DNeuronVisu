# 3DNeuronVisu
Research project at Ecole Polytechnique, data set can't be provided for privacy reasons.

#Objectives
This project is to be considered as part of research on connectomic
The goal of this field of research is to obtain fast a full map of neuronal connection in the human brain.

In this project we start from a new set of data from 2-photon microscopy of higher quality.
The goal is to design a pipeline to manage automatically these informations, i.e: going from voxels to large scale informations on neurons.

#Achievements:
We have implemented a pre-processing pipeline and working on now working on algorithm using positional and color space informations.
